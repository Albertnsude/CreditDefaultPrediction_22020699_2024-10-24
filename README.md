Analysing and Comparing Machine Learning Approaches for Credit Default Prediction 
Summary
In the financial sector, credit default prediction is crucial for managing risk, helping firms identify high-risk clients and take preventive actions. This project evaluates the effectiveness of three machine learning algorithms—XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression—in predicting credit defaults. It assesses the predictive accuracy and feature selection of these models to determine the best method for credit risk modelling. Using datasets from Credit Risk Analytics and Kaggle, the study contributes to the growing knowledge in credit risk management and machine learning applications.
Background
 To minimize losses, optimize lending strategies, and assess the likelihood of customer default, banks and financial institutions rely on credit risk prediction models. While logistic regression has traditionally been used, the advent of machine learning (ML) algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost has introduced more accurate and efficient alternatives. These models can process large datasets and identify complex patterns, making them vital for risk management decision-making (Noriega et al., 2023). Several researchers have contributed to this field. Bahnsen et al. (2015) introduced cost-sensitive logistic regression to reduce the misclassification of high-risk customers, while Ngai et al. (2010) and Lessmann et al. (2015) demonstrated ML's superiority over traditional techniques in credit scoring and fraud detection. Consoli et al. (2021) emphasized the role of data science and ML in improving the accuracy and efficiency of financial analytics.
XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression remain the most popular algorithms for credit default prediction. Logistic regression estimates binary outcomes, but Random Forest and XGBoost offer more advanced methods. Random Forest builds multiple decision trees for enhanced accuracy, while XGBoost excels with large datasets through its gradient-boosting technique (Noriega et al., 2023). Comparing these models and employing feature selection are essential for improving predictive accuracy and identifying key predictors in credit risk management
